# Flash Cards

This React application is a flash card web app. Currently, the type of questions are in Japanese for demo purposes, but the type of questions can be adjusted for the user.

[Deployed](https://gerarjon.github.io/flash-cards/) or [Here](https://flashcards-gs.herokuapp.com/)

Users have the ability to view cards with text on the front and the back. They can set the card aside if the card is difficult or they want further review. The reviewed cards then get used after all the cards in the rotation are answered. 

![Submit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47680567/129431306-3b326e36-a367-43b4-a761-4d8221506b2f.gif)
Another feature is that users attempt to write the phrase or question in English. Punctuation and capitalization is not necessary, the words just need to be in the correct order and spelling. The submit questions have the same feature as the flashcard questions. 

## Main techonologies

## Suggestions
Suggestions for further improvement in terms of usability, design, and type of questions are encouraged! Things that are in development: 
- other types of questions other than flashcards and submit
- rating system for a user to rate the difficulty of their flashcard
